Create A Repo
If you’ve found yourself on this page, we’re assuming you’re brand new to Git and GitHub. 
This guide will walk you through the basics and explain a little bit
 about how everything works along the way.
First: Create A Repo

Every time you make a commit with Git, it is stored in a repository (a.k.a. “repo”). 
To put your project up on GitHub, you’ll need to have a GitHub repository for it to live in.
More about repositories

    Create a new repo

    Click New Repository.
    Click “New Repository

    Fill out the information on this page. When you’re done, click “Create Repository.”
    Fill in the info

    Congratulations! You have successfully created your first repo!

Next: Create a README for your repo.

While a README isn’t a required part of a GitHub repo, it is a good idea to have one. 
READMEs are a great place to describe your project or add some documentation such as
 how to install or use your project.
More about READMEs

    Create the README file

    In the prompt, type the following code:

        $ mkdir ~/Hello-World
        $ cd ~/Hello-World
        $ git init
        
        $ touch README......
        

    Open the new README file found in your Hello-World directory in a text editor and add the text “Hello World!”
 When you are finished, save and close the file.

    Commit your README

    Now that you have your README set up, it’s time to commit it. 
A commit is essentially a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time. 
In the prompt, type the following code:
    More about commits

        $ git add README
        $ git commit -m 'first commit'
        

    The code above executes actions locally, meaning you still haven’t done anything on GitHub yet.
 To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your 
repo and push your commits to it

    $ git add README
    $ git commit -m 'first commit'
    

The code above executes actions locally, meaning you still haven’t done anything on GitHub yet.
 To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your repo and push your commits to it:
More about remotes

    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/Hello-World.git
    $ git push origin master
    

Now if you look at your repository on GitHub, you will see your README has been added to it
